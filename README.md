# Create

ðŸ›  A simple command-line utility to create files written in Node.

Why does this exist? Well because I had fun making it and also there really isn't a good way to create files from the command line on windows, also you can recursively create directories and add files.

### Installation

-   Option 1 (for people with npm): `npm i -g @vanajmoorthy/create`
-   Option 2 (for general users): Download the release from [releases](https://github.com/vanajmoorthy/create/releases) and install it.

### Usage

-   create takes one input, the name of the file you want to create or the path to the file with the filename at the end

*   Eg: `create foo.txt` or `create pathtofoo/foo.txt` or even `create pathtofoo/foo/foo.txt`
