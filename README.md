# Create

ðŸ›  A simple command-line utility to create files written in Node.

Why does this exist? Well because I had fun making it and also there really isn't a good way to create files from the command line on windows.

### Usage

-   Option 1 (for people with npm): `npm i -g @vanajmoorthy/create`
-   Option 2 (for general users): Download the release from releases and install it.
